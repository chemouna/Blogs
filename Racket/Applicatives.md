# Applicative

Applicative functors generalize function application to work with any kind of data structure, not just procedures.

## apply and pure 
### apply 
The same as base:apply but with support for any sequence as the final argument instead of only lists. Just like in base:apply, #:<kw> stands for any keyword.



## TODO 
- is it exactly the same as in haskell ?
