# Category Theory 

## Categories

-  in many cases category theory has encouraged, or at least facilitated, a change
of perspective. When one studies mathematics, one often wants to study mathematical objects: sets,
groups, topological spaces, Lie groups, etc. In category theory, however, at least as much emphasis is
placed on maps between objects as on the objects themselves, and in many cases it turns out to be
much more fruitful to make the maps the center of focus.


### Examples 

- example in topology of Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg  


#### Sets 

#### Groups 

#### PoSets

#### Abelian groups xb

#### linear ...

#### Topos theory

#### Topological spaces

#### Cartesian closed categories 

### Small Categories
- A category C is called small if the collection Ob(C ) of objects forms a set.

### Implementation in Haskell 

### Haskell Function and Types do they form a category 

### Examples of Library design using category theory

### Haskell & CT 
- So the question to ask isn't "what category does Haskell live in?" but "what class of category corresponds to the internal language in which I wrote this bit of code?".  


#### Class of categories for the internal languages in haskell 

##### For Do notation

### Isomorphism, Monomorphisms and Epimorphisms

#### Examples on some categories 
- On Sets 

- Example Logarithm and exponential 
  (log is an isomorphism)

- Examples in haskell/ML 

- identifying how well behaved a category is based on inspecting isom/epim/monom

#### automorphism
 - examples in Haskell 

### Monoidal Category
