## Categories

### Examples 


#### Sets 

#### Groups 

#### PoSets

#### Abelian groups 

#### linear ...

#### Topos theory
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/topos

#### Topological spaces

#### Cartesian closed categories 

### Small Categories

### Implementation in Haskell 

### Haskell Function and Types do they form a category 

### Examples of Library design using category theory

### Haskell & CT 
- So the question to ask isn't "what category does Haskell live in?" but "what class of category corresponds to the internal language in which I wrote this bit of code?".  


#### Class of categories for the internal languages in haskell 

##### For Do notation 
(http://blog.sigfpe.com/2008/11/some-thoughts-on-reasoning-and-monads.html)

### Isomorphism, Monomorphisms and Epimorphisms

#### Examples on some categories 
- On Sets 

- Example Logarithm and exponential 
  (log is an isomorphism)

- Examples in haskell/ML 

- identifying how well behaved a category is based on inspecting isom/epim/monom

#### automorphism
 - examples in Haskell 

### Monoidal Category
