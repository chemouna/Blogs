# Radix Sort 
The idea of Radix Sort is to do digit by digit sort starting from least significant digit to most significant digit. Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort.

## Efficiency/Complexity 
 Radix sort complexity is O(wn) for n keys which are integers of word size w. 
 Sometimes w is presented as a constant, which would make radix sort better 
 (for sufficiently large n) than the best comparison-based sorting algorithms,
 which all perform O(n log n) comparisons to sort n keys. However, in general 
 w cannot be considered a constant: if all n keys are distinct, then w has to 
 be at least log n for a random-access machine to be able to store them in memory, 
 which gives at best a time complexity O(n log n).
