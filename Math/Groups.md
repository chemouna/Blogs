## Semigroup 

### Semigroup examples
- a semigroup with no elements (the empty semigroup) is a semigroup in which the underlying set is the empty set 
  In category theory, the empty semigroup is always admitted. It is the unique initial object of the category of semigroups.

#### Trivial semigroup
a semigroup with one element is a semigroup for which the cardinality of the underlying set is one. 

#### Semigroup with two elements
a semigroup with two elements is a semigroup for which the cardinality of the underlying set is two. 
##### Examples
- ({0,1}, ∧) (where "∧" is the logical connective "and"), or equivalently the set {0,1} under multiplication
- (Z2, +2) (where Z2 = {0,1} and "+2" is "addition modulo 2"), or equivalently the set {−1,1} under multiplication: the only group of order two.


## Monoid 
A monoid is an algebraic structure intermediate between groups and semigroups, and is a semigroup having an identity element, thus obeying all but one of the axioms of a group; existence of inverses is not required of a monoid.

- A monoid is a semigroup with an identity element.
- A group is a monoid in which every element has an inverse element.
