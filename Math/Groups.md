## Abelian Groups
 an abelian group is a commutative group. A group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a "non-abelian group" or "non-commutative group".

## Semigroup 

### Semigroup examples
- a semigroup with no elements (the empty semigroup) is a semigroup in which the underlying set is the empty set 
  In category theory, the empty semigroup is always admitted. It is the unique initial object of the category of semigroups.

#### Trivial semigroup
a semigroup with one element is a semigroup for which the cardinality of the underlying set is one. 

#### Semigroup with two elements
a semigroup with two elements is a semigroup for which the cardinality of the underlying set is two. 
##### Examples
- ({0,1}, ∧) (where "∧" is the logical connective "and"), or equivalently the set {0,1} under multiplication
- (Z2, +2) (where Z2 = {0,1} and "+2" is "addition modulo 2"), or equivalently the set {−1,1} under multiplication: the only group of order two.

#### Regular semigroup
 - a regular semigroup is a semigroup S in which every element is regular, i.e., for each element a, 
   there exists an element x such that axa = a
 
 
## Monoid 
A monoid is an algebraic structure intermediate between groups and semigroups, and is a semigroup having an identity element, thus obeying all but one of the axioms of a group; existence of inverses is not required of a monoid.

- A monoid is a semigroup with an identity element.
- A group is a monoid in which every element has an inverse element.

## Magma 
A magma is a set M matched with an operation, •, that sends any two elements a, b ∈ M to another element, a • b. The symbol, •, is a general placeholder for a properly defined operation. 
To qualify as a magma, the set and operation (M, •) must satisfy the following requirement (known as the magma or closure axiom):
For all a, b in M, the result of the operation a • b is also in M.
