# Isomorphisms

is a homomorphism or morphism that admits an inverse.
- For most algebraic structures, including groups and rings, a homomorphism is an isomorphism 
 if and only if it is bijective.
- In topology, where the morphisms are continuous functions, isomorphisms are also called homeomorphisms or bicontinuous functions. 

A morphism f : X → Y in a category is an isomorphism if it admits a two-sided inverse, meaning that there is another morphism 
g : Y → X in that category such that gf = 1X and fg = 1Y, where 1X and 1Y are the identity morphisms of X and Y


## Automorphism 
- An automorphism is an isomorphism whose source and target coincide 

### Examples 

#### In Haskell 


## Canonical Isomorphism
 canonical isomorphism is a canonical map that is an isomorphism. Two objects are said to be canonically 
  isomorphic if there is a canonical isomorphism between them.
 If f is a ring homomorphism from a commutative ring R to commutative ring S, then S can be viewed as an algebra over R. 
 The ring homomorphism f is then called the structure map (for the algebra structure). The corresponding map on the prime 
 spectra: Spec(S) →Spec(R) is also called the structure map.
 
canonical map : 
is a map or morphism between objects that arises naturally from the definition or the construction of the objects.
ex :  f mapping a set X->X/R (X modulo R), where R is an equivalence relation in X, is called a canonical map.
